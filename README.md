**Welcome to BMI503: Biomedical Informatics Systems, Databases, and Software Methods!!!**

We will spend the semester learning, discussing, and implementing programming languages, statistical techniques, databases creation, access, and maintenance, and aspects of research design. We will focus mostly on Python as our preferred language, but we will also learn some basics in SQL (structure query language), Bash, and R when relevant and needed. We will become efficient users of various languages, tools, and techniques and apply these skills on biomedical data, including biological, clinical, and/or chemical data.

I do not expect or require anyone taking this course to have experience with programming. We will start with the very basics so everyone has the same foundation. We will then quickly ramp up to more advanced topics as the semester proceeds. The only prerequisite for this course is a strong desire to learn Python (and other programming languages) as it applies to Biomedical Informatics.

*The goal of this class is to ensure each student learns a significant amount of programming to be able to execute basic computational tasks, e.g., data access, manipulation, analysis, and visualization.*
